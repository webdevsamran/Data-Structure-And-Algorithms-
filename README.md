## Why PHP?

While data structures and algorithms are traditionally associated with languages like C++ or Java, learning them in PHP can offer unique advantages. PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language, making it a valuable skill for web developers. Understanding data structures and algorithms in the context of PHP not only enhances problem-solving abilities but also provides practical insights into optimizing web applications.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into different categories, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. Below are the main sections you can explore:

- **Data Structures:**
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
  - Hash Tables
  - Graphs

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Divide and Conquer

Each category contains detailed explanations, implementation examples, and practical use cases to help you grasp the concepts effectively.
