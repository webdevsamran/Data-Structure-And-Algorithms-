## Why PHP?

PHP, known for its role in server-side scripting, offers a unique perspective on data structures and algorithms. Understanding these concepts in a web-centric language provides practical insights into optimizing web applications. PHP is widely used in web development, making it a valuable skill for developers working on dynamic websites. This repository aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation within the PHP ecosystem.

## Structure of the Repository

Master the concepts of singly and doubly linked lists, and understand how they can be used to efficiently manage data.

#### Stacks

Learn about the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle and its applications in algorithmic problem-solving.

#### Queues

Explore the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle and how queues are employed in various scenarios.

#### Trees

Study different types of trees, such as binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees, and understand their properties and applications.

#### Hash Tables

Delve into the world of hash tables and learn how to efficiently store and retrieve data using key-value pairs.

#### Graphs

Explore graph theory and its applications through adjacency lists and matrices.

### Algorithms

#### Sorting Algorithms

Learn and implement various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort.

#### Searching Algorithms
